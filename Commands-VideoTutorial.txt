> db.createCollection('customers');  (create a collection called Customers [similar to tables in RDBMS. They store "documents"(or records)])

> show collections 

> db.customers.insert({firstName:"felipe", lastName:"padua"});

> db.customers.insert([{firstName:"felipe", lastName:"padua"},{firstName:"brianna", lastName:"kress", address:{street: "rua bla bla", city:"lavras"}, memberships: [mem1,mem2], gender:"female"}]); (Insert more than one; I also added a field called 'gender' and 'address' for the last document)

> db.customers.find();  (To show all the documents in the collection)
OR
> db.customers.find().pretty(); (To show the result with a better identation)

> db.customers.findOne({"name": "felipe"}); (Returns only the first match)

> db.customers.update({firstName:"Brianna"},{firstName:"Brianna", lastName:"padua kress", gender:"female"});  (first paramater is the Match [it will update objects which have firstName as 'Brianna']; second parameter is the updated document [you have to retype ALL fields - There is a workaround for that bellow with the 'SET'])

// The SET operator is a variation for the 'update' 
> db.customers.update({lastName:"silva"},{$set:{gender:"male"}}); (It will only add the field 'gender' and it will keep the other fields)

//UNSET - to remove a 
db.customers.update({lastName:"silva"},{$unset:{age:1}}); (remove AGE field)

> db.customers.update({lastName:"padua"},{$inc:{age:5}}); (to increment the age by 5)

> db.customers.update({firstName:"john"},{firstName:"john wayne", lastName:"armindo"},{upsert: true}); (It is going to update any document with firstName as john. If none, it is going to create a new document with these values)

// Change the name a Field
> db.customers.update({firstName:"Brianna"},{$rename{"gender":"sex"}});

// [VI] There is also "updateOne()" and "updateMany()"

// To remove
> db.customers.remove({firstName:"john"});

// [VI] There is also "deleteOne()" and "deleteMany()"
> db.movies.deleteOne({_id:ObjectId("59b4a....")});

// Remove only the first document that matched (in this case: firstName)
> db.customers.remove({firstName:"john"},{justOne:true}); (even though, say, there were many "john", it will only delete the first found )

> db.customers.find({firstName:"felipe"}).pretty(); (find all docs with firstName="felipe")

// OR Operator
> db.customers.find({$or:[{firstName:"felipe"},{firstName:"brianna"}]}).pretty(); (find all docs with firstName="felipe" or "brianna")

// lt (less than), gt (greater than)
// lte (less than or equal to), gte (greater than or equal to)
> db.customers.find({age:{$lt:40}}); (find all customers with age < 40)

// SEE Insert on line 23
> db.customers.find({"address.city":"lavras"}); (find customers who live in Lavras)
PS: Note that you have to put address.city between quotes. (Newer versions might not need the quotes anymore. Check and see if it works)

// SEE Insert on line 23
> db.customers.find({memberships:"mem1"}); (find customers with 'mem1' in memberships array)

// Sorting
> db.customers.find().sort({lastName:1}); (PS: one means ASCENDING order, for DESCENDING put: {lastName:-1} )

// COUNT
> db.customers.find({lastName:"padua"}).count();

// LIMIT
> db.customers.find().limit(4); (It will only show the first 4)

// COMBINE LIMIT AND SORT
> db.customers.find().limit(4).sort({lastName:1});

// [VI] FOREACH, declare FUNCTION and print
> db.customers.find().forEach(function(x){print("Customer Name:" + x.firstName)});

--------------------------------------
-----> FROM MONGODB UNIVERSITY COURSE:

- You can create or own "_id" instead of letting Mongo generates one for you.
- You can also insert many elements at once:
- You can do ORDERED or UNORDERED inserts. (The default is ordered)
   - UNORDERED means that if one document fails to be inserted (say it has a duplicate _id), it will not stop (ordered) and it 
   wll insert the rest of thedocuments.
   
> db.myMovies.insertMany(
    [
        {
	    "_id" : "tt0084726",
	    "title" : "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan",
	    "year" : 1982,
	    "type" : "movie"
        },        
        {
	    "_id" : "tt1408101",
	    "title" : "Star Trek Into Darkness",
	    "year" : 2013,
	    "type" : "movie"
        },
        {
	    "_id" : "tt0117731",
	    "title" : "Star Trek: First Contact",
	    "year" : 1996,
	    "type" : "movie"
        }
    ],
    {
	ordered: false
    }
  );


> db.movieDetails.find({"awards.wins":2,"awards.nominations":2}).count()
  (find the amount [count()]  of collections with awards.wins=2 AND awards.nominations=2)
  
  > db.movies.find({"cast": "Angelina Jolie"}).pretty();
    (Find documents which contains the element "Angelina Jolie" in the Array called  "cast")
    
 > db.movies.find({"cast.0": "Angelina Jolie"}).pretty();
    (Find documents which contains the element "Angelina Jolie" as the FIRST ELEMENT in the Array called  "cast")


// Limit the field(s) you want to retrieve (Increases performance and saves network traffic)
> db.movies.find({genre: "Action, Adventure"}, {title:1 , _id:0});
	// Find movies with genre = action & adventure a INCLUDE the title and EXCLUDE _id.
	   As a result, it will only display the title field.  
(PS: 1- include this field, 0- exclude this field ; 
 By default it will retrieve the _id, but you can exclude it if you want.)

 > db.movies.UpdateOne({title: "The Martian"},{set:{ priceOnAmazon: 14.00}}); 
 (Only update the first document that matches the filter)
   // PS: it will create the field "priceOnAmazon", if it already exists, it will modify it to the new value

   // CHECK: All Update operators ($set, $unset, $rename, etc.):

** [Very Important]- ALL OPERATORS: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/

> db.movieDetails.find({runtime: {$gt: 90, $lte: 120}}, {_id: 0, title: 1, runtime: 1})
  (All movies with a runtime greater than 90 minutes AND less than or equal to 120; show only title field)
  
> db.movieDetails.find({runtime: {$gte: 180}, "tomato.meter": 100}, {_id: 0, title: 1, runtime: 1})
  (All movies with a runtime greater than 180 and tomato.meter = 100; show only title and runtime field)

> db.movieDetails.find({rated: {$in: ["G", "PG"]}}, {_id: 0, title: 1, rated: 1})
  (movies with rated = G or PG)
  
- $exists : Matches documents that have the specified field.

- $all : Matches arrays that contain all elements specified in the query.

- [VI] Regex: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/regex/#op._S_regex 
> db.movieDetails.find({"awards.text": {$regex: /^Won.* /}}, {_id: 0, title: 1, "awards.text": 1}).pretty()
  (fond movies with the object field awards.text containing "Won ...."; returns ontle Title and Awards.text fields)

    (You can declare variables, use built-in JS functions like push(<value>) ta add an item to array, etc)

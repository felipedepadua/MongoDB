> show dbs (to show databases)

> use <db_name> (to switch to a database AND create the DB in case it does not exist yet)

> db (to check which DB you are in)

>db.createUser({
	user: "Felipe",
	pwd: "123",
	roles: ["readWrite","dbAdmin"]
});
	PS: This is a simple one. Check other examples on the link below.
	SOURCE: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.createUser/

> db.createCollection('customers');  (create a collection called Customers [similar to tables in RDBMS. They store "documents"(or records)])

> show collections 

> db.customers.insert({firstName:"felipe", lastName:"padua"});

> db.customers.insert([{firstName:"felipe", lastName:"padua"},{firstName:"brianna", lastName:"kress", gender:"female"}]); (Insert more than one; I also added a field called 'gender' for the last document)

> db.customers.find();  (To show all the documents in the collection)
OR
> db.customers.find().pretty(); (To show the result with a better identation)

> db.customers.update({firstName:"Brianna"},{firstName:"Brianna", lastName:"padua kress", gender:"female"});  (first paramater is the Match [it will update objects which have firstName as 'Brianna']; second parameter is the updated document [you have to retype ALL fields - There is a workaround for that bellow with the 'SET'])

// The SET operator is a variation for the 'update' 
> db.customers.update({lastName:"silva"},{$set:{gender:"male"}}); (It will only add the field 'gender' and it will keep the other fields)
